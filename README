To do:
	Readables:
		Buffer
			-specify period, loads that amount of data from a readable
			-like a clip for synthesizable
		Waveforms:
			Triangle
		Filters:
			Low pass, High pass, Finite Impulse Response
		Modifiers:
			Speed, [Pitch, Timbre](filters?)
			Smooth Clipping
	Music Theory:
		Notes from scale + base note
		Notes from chords
	Clojure bindings
	Sequencer.
		-String input for osc format
			Something like "/1/push/[1-9]"
			Returns a collection of bindings for push 1 through push 9
			Bound to clojure code
	Wave Analysis
		Visualizer (amplitude over time)
		Frequency domain (histogram)
		Spectrogram (frequency domain over time)

**Use Collections for all parameters to facilitate Clojure interop**
