To do:
	Figure out the best way to have readables
	register themselves with the synthesizer when played
	Readables:
		Waveforms:
			Sine, Triangle, Pulse, white noise
		Filters:
			Low pass, High pass, Finite Impulse Response
		Modifiers:
			Adder, Multiplier (waveform or number), Speed, [Pitch, Timbre](filters?)
			Smooth Clipping, Soft Clipping
	Music Theory:
		Notes from scale + base note
		Notes from chords
	Clojure bindings
	Sequencer.	

**Use Collections for all parameters to facilitate Clojure interop**
